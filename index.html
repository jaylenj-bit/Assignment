<h1>Jaylen Johnson</h1>
<p>The first thing I would tell someone that asks to know more about me is that I love to learn. The world is infinitely interesting to me and I love its complexity because it's deeply interesting and the reward from learning all about it is that I get to express that knowledge to others. </p>
<br>
<p>Some of the main areas I study are Wildlife Biology, Astrophysics, Neuroscience (only a little bit) and more to come. For work I am a web developer, meaning I make and/or upgrade websites for businesses but later on I want to get into data analytics. I love money, video games, learning, and being the best me I can be.</p>
